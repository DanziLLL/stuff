C++ (pronounced as cee plus plus, /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language.
It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level
memory manipulation.
It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems,
with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[3]
C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure
and resource-constrained applications,[3] including desktop applications, servers
(e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications
(e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[4] C++ is a compiled language, with implementations
of it available on many platforms and provided by various organizations, including the FSF, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel
and IBM.
C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
(and current) standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2014 as ISO/IEC 14882:2014
(informally known as C++14).[5] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as
ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, ISO/IEC 14882:2003, standard.
The current C++14 standard supersedes these and C++11, with new features and an enlarged standard library.
Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979,
as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C,
which also provided high-level features for program organization.
Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, Java, and newer versions of C (after 1998).
